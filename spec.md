# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the application's visual theme with a new color scheme and change all currency displays to Ghana Cedis (GH₵).

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the current color palette in CSS files with the user-provided color codes, affecting backgrounds, borders, text colors, and accent colors across all pages and components
- Change all monetary value displays throughout the application to use Ghana Cedis (GH₵) format with the GH₵ symbol prefix and two decimal places

**User-visible outcome:** The application will display with the new color scheme in both light and dark modes, and all prices, amounts, and financial metrics will show in Ghana Cedis currency format (GH₵).
